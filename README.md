## What has changed from the original

- Added a new tier of table with a 11x11 grid and Netherite components
- Auto Table Speed is now configurable per tier (default to 8gt/0.4s per craft)
- Auto Table item input logic reworked to allow the table to keep up, can now import more than one item per tick.
- JEI Compatibility: Recipes with no tier restriction are only shown in the smallest table that can fit them. Tier-restricted recipes still show the warning icon.
